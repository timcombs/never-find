#X text 35 30 trandom \; \; current time based random numbers \; \;
\; The standard random object is not a real random number generator
\, it's a pseudo-random generator and each time you run a patch with
a random with a given seed the generated random numbers will be always
the same \, as long as you run a new istance f Pd each time. \; \;
If the same random numbers for each time a patch is opened are not
desirable \, a way to change the seed for each boot is required. \;
\; In this patch the seed is computed by summing all the numbers coming
from a time object which is part of the zexy library (https://puredata.info/downloads/zexy).
\; \; In this way a new seed for each run of the patch is granted \,
and the random numbers will be different. \; \; This is not really
a true random \, but in some applications it can be better than the
standard one. \; \; This object can be used just as the standard random.
\; \; \; This patch was wired by fbipolare for Randio Radio (http://www.randio.it).
